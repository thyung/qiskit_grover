## Overview
Quick revision to Grover's algorithm and solve a Boolean Satisfiability Problem.  Then, apply to a Travelling Salesman Problem.  As Grover's algorithm is $O(sqrt(N)), both problems are still in exponential time.

## Content
1. [Chapter 1](01_grover_sat.ipynb) Grover's algorithm revision and illustrate with an example Boolean Satisfiability Problem.

2. [Chapter 2](02_grover_tsp.ipynb) attempt to solve a 4 nodes Travelling Salesman Problem.  

## Notes
1. Qiskit 1.0.2 or up is required.
